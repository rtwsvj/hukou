# Homebrew formula for hukou.
#
# Status: PREPARED, NOT YET SUBMITTED. The release v0.3.0 does not exist yet
# (the project is on a private pre-release RC), so `sha256` is a placeholder
# that MUST be filled from the real archive before submission. See
# docs/homebrew.md for the complete, step-by-step submission checklist.
#
# Local validation performed: `ruby -c` syntax pass and `brew style` clean.
# `brew install` / `brew audit --strict` deliberately were NOT run here: they
# would install hukou on this machine or need the public release to exist.
